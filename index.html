            <h3>Georgia</h3>
            <p>
              Georgia has become one of the most consistent and versatile outbound destinations from India, largely due to its visa ease, compact geography, and wide appeal across traveller segments.
From a selling perspective, Georgia allows agents to comfortably cater to FITs, families, honeymoons, and small groups without overcomplicating logistics. The destination offers a good balance of city exploration, scenic mountain drives, cultural experiences, and leisure time — making it suitable for both first-time international travellers and repeat travellers.
Operationally, Georgia works well for 4–8 night itineraries, with flexible routing across Tbilisi, Gudauri, Kazbegi, Batumi and nearby regions. Seasonal planning is important, and itineraries can be adapted easily for summer sightseeing, shoulder-season leisure, or winter travel with a focus on snow destinations.
Caravan Compass supports agents with realistic pacing, hotel planning, and route optimisation, ensuring itineraries are practical on ground and aligned with traveller expectations.

            <h3>Armenia</h3>
            <p>
              Armenia is a culturally rich, compact destination that works best for travellers looking beyond mainstream city breaks. It appeals strongly to clients interested in history, heritage sites, scenic landscapes, and a slower, more immersive travel experience.
From a trade perspective, Armenia is well-suited for cultural travellers, niche groups, senior travellers, and repeat international flyers. It can be sold as a short standalone itinerary or combined seamlessly with Georgia for clients looking for a multi-country experience within a manageable travel duration.
Distances are short, allowing for comfortable day excursions from Yerevan to surrounding monasteries, lakes and countryside. This makes itinerary planning straightforward, while still offering enough depth for meaningful travel.
Our role is to help agents position Armenia correctly — not as a rushed sightseeing destination, but as a well-paced, experience-driven journey supported by reliable local coordination.

            <h3>Azerbaijan</h3>
            <p>
              Azerbaijan is primarily a city-centric destination, with Baku forming the core of most itineraries. It works well for short international breaks, FITs, families, and select group movements where clean logistics and timing are essential.
From a planning point of view, Azerbaijan is ideal for 4–6 night programmes, combining modern city experiences with nearby excursions such as Gobustan and Absheron. The destination is particularly suitable for clients who prefer structured sightseeing, comfortable city hotels, and a clear itinerary flow.
Caravan Compass works with trusted local partners to ensure smooth coordination, clear inclusions, and realistic scheduling, allowing agents to sell the destination with confidence.
Azerbaijan also pairs well as an add-on or alternative for clients seeking something different from typical European city breaks.
